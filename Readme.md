# Fuzzy Bullet List Deduplication

This Python project provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to remove duplicate bullet points from a list of bullet points. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library and fuzzy string matching is performed using the fuzzywuzzy library.

## Installation

To run the project, you will need to have Python 3 and the fuzzywuzzy library installed. You can install the library by running the following command:

`pip install fuzzywuzzy` 

Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, you can run the project by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:

`python main.py` 

Alternatively, if you are running Windows, you can run the provided exe file in the 'Releases' section to the right.

## Usage

Once you have the project running, enter a list of bullet points in the input box and specify a similarity threshold (between 0 and 100). Click the "Convert" button to remove duplicate bullet points from the input list and display the cleaned list in the output box.
